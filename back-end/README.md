## What is this directory about?
This directory includes the `back-end` functionality of `KGSEC` tool. To run it the user should first make sure that all the dependencies of `requirements.txt` file are installed. Paths should be also configured in a `config.json` file, filled with data as explained in the `config_sample.json` file. 

To run the `back-end` users should run the following command:

```
$ python3 app.py
```
Then the api is accesible at endpoint: 
```
